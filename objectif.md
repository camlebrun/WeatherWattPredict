# Project Objective:

Accurately predict future energy demand by integrating predictive models based on meteorological data, historical trends, and other relevant variables. The primary goal is to optimize energy production planning, providing reliable and real-time forecasts of energy demand to effectively meet the needs of the electrical grid while minimizing operational costs.

**Specific Objectives:**

1. **Temporal Precision:** Develop a model capable of predicting energy demand at different time scales, from hourly to seasonal, to address the specific planning needs of operators.

2. **Incorporation of Meteorological Data:** Integrate meteorological data such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc., to capture the influence of weather conditions on energy demand.

3. **Analysis of Historical Trends:** Use historical data to identify and model seasonal trends, weekly variations, and other recurrent patterns, enabling more accurate predictions.

4. **Management of Holidays and Special Events:** Adapt the model to account for variations in energy demand related to holidays and special events, ewnsuring appropriate planning during these periods.

5. **Resource Optimization:** Provide accurate forecasts to enable electrical grid operators to adjust energy production based on predicted demand, minimizing operational costs and optimizing resource utilization.

6. **Real-time Adaptability:** Design the model to be adaptable in real-time, integrating frequent updates of meteorological data and adjusting forecasts based on unforeseen changes.

7. **Performance Metrics:** Establish clear performance metrics, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), to evaluate the model's effectiveness and ensure consistent prediction quality.

**Identification of Stakeholder Needs:**

- **Electrical Grid Operators:** Need accurate forecasts for effective energy production planning, minimizing shortages and surpluses.

- **Power Plant Managers:** Require adjustments in production based on predicted demand to maximize operational efficiency and minimize costs.

- **Regulatory Authorities:** Need to ensure stability of the electrical grid and promote sustainable use of energy resources.

- **Consumers:** Desire reliability in energy supply and stable tariffs, which depend directly on production planning based on accurate forecasts.
