*(Genereated with Image Creator)* 
This is a roadmap for the project. It will be updated as the project progresses.
## Project Objective

### 1.    Define the Project Objective:

   [X] Clarify the specific objectives of predicting energy demand. Identify the needs of stakeholders such as electrical grid operators, power plant managers, etc.

## Data Collection

### 2. Data Collection:

   - Gather historical meteorological data (temperature, humidity, wind, etc.).
   - Obtain historical data on energy demand.
   - Integrate other relevant variables, such as holidays, days of the week, special events, etc.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

   - Analyze temporal and seasonal trends in the data.
   - Identify correlations between energy demand and meteorological variables.
   - Handle missing or aberrant values in the data.

## Data Preprocessing

### 4. Data Preprocessing:

   - Normalize and standardize the data.
   - Convert temporal data into exploitable time series.
   - Separate training and test sets.

## Predictive Model Construction

### 5. Predictive Model Construction:

   - Choose a model: Use models such as neural networks, time series models, ensemble methods, etc.
   - Train the model on the training data.
   - Optimize model hyperparameters to improve performance.

## Model Validation and Evaluation

### 6. Validation and Evaluation of the Model:

   - Evaluate the model's performance on the test set.
   - Use appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Square Error (RMSE).
   - Readjust the model if necessary.

## Integration of Results

### 7. Integration of Results:

   - Integrate the model into a production environment.
   - Automate the real-time prediction process, if possible.

## Continuous Monitoring

### 8. Continuous Monitoring:

   - Establish a monitoring system to track model performance over time.
   - Perform periodic updates to the model based on new data and behavioral changes.

## Documentation

### 9. Documentation:

   - Document the process, model choices, results, and considerations.
   - Create a user manual for end-users.

## Communication of Results

### 10. Communication of Results:

    - Prepare result reports for stakeholders.
    - Explain recommendations and operational implications.

By following this roadmap, you should be able to build a robust predictive model for energy demand, significantly impacting energy production planning and resource optimization.
